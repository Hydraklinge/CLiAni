Clani is a commandline program for any Linux distro written in C/C++, which can display different (noise) algorithms and effects with ascii characters using ncurses. This allows for some cool scrolling patterns and other animation effects.
The purpose of this project is not well defined and just something I work on by the side for fun.

The project uses CMake v3.15 and C++14.
